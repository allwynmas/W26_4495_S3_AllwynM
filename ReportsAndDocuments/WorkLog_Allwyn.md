| Date       | Number of Hours | Description of Work |
|------------|------------------|----------------------|
| 15th Jan   | 2                | Conducted initial research on OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and reviewed documentation for DVWA, WebGoat, and Juice Shop. Compared their learning approaches and identified opportunities for a simpler, framework based platform. |
| 20th Jan   | 1                | Participated in instructor led project consultation. Discussed project direction, technology stack, and how to embed vulnerabilities safely within a Spring Boot MVC application. |
| 21st Jan   | 1.5              | Co drafted the pre proposal for instructor approval. Summarized research findings and outlined the initial problem definition, research questions, and project scope. |
| 22nd Jan   | 1                | Researched Spring Boot security misconfigurations and common vulnerability patterns (e.g., insecure authentication flows, improper input validation). Documented potential implementation strategies. |
| 23rd Jan   | 1                | Attended scheduled Friday team meeting. Finalized task distribution and reviewed proposal template. |
| 23rd Jan   | 1.5              | Created and organized the GitHub Project Kanban board. Added tasks for proposal writing, research, vulnerability implementation, and documentation. Assigned responsibilities and set up workflow columns. |
| 24th Jan   | 2                | Collaborated with Thilan on drafting the full project proposal. Wrote sections on scope, methodology, and technology stack. Ensured the proposal met the rubric requirements for introduction and research design. |
| 25th Jan   | 2                | Continued refining the proposal independently. Reviewed the draft for clarity, strengthened the methodology section, and added additional justification for the selected technology stack. Prepared notes for the upcoming Saturday meeting. |
| 26th Jan   | 1                | Reviewed and refined the proposal draft. Added details to the methodology and expected results sections. Submitted the document to Blackboard and GitHub. |
| 27th Jan   | 1                | Participated in in‑class proposal check‑in. Instructor requested adding industry data to justify the project. Reviewed Fortinet’s 2024 Skills Gap Report and incorporated the statistic that 58% of IT decision‑makers cite lack of hands‑on skills as a top cause of breaches.  |
| 31st Jan   | 1                | Attended scheduled Friday team meeting. Discussed Week 5 implementation tasks, including setting up the Spring Boot skeleton and configuring the H2 database. |
| 1st Feb    | 1.5              | Attended scheduled Saturday team meeting. Reviewed architecture outline and refined backend workflow diagrams. Finalized vulnerability placement strategy for SQL Injection, Broken Authentication, and IDOR. |
| 3rd Feb    | 1                | Began setting up backend project structure. Created initial controller and service templates to prepare for SQL Injection implementation. |
| 4th Feb    | 1.5              | Completed Spring Boot skeleton setup. Verified project builds successfully, configured H2 database, and tested basic backend routing. |
| 5th Feb    | 1                | Conducted deeper research on SQL Injection exploitation in Java applications. Reviewed insecure query patterns and prepared notes for implementing the first vulnerability. |
| 6th Feb    | 1                | Drafted backend‑focused content for Progress Report 1, summarizing architecture planning, backend setup, and SQL Injection research. |
