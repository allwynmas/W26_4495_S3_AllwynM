# Insecure by Design  
*A Hands‑On Learning Platform for Web Security Training*  
CSIS 4495 – Applied Research Project (Winter 2026)

## 📌 Project Overview
Insecure by Design is an intentionally vulnerable web application built using **Spring Boot MVC**.  
Its purpose is to provide a **safe, controlled, and realistic environment** for learners to explore, exploit, and understand common web vulnerabilities.

Modern cybersecurity education emphasizes hands‑on learning, yet many existing platforms rely on outdated technologies or lack structured guidance. Industry data reinforces this gap according to Fortinet’s 2024 Cybersecurity Skills Gap Report, **58% of IT decision‑makers say the top cause of security breaches is staff lacking practical cybersecurity skills and training**.  
This project directly addresses that need.

Our platform integrates vulnerabilities into realistic workflows, helping learners understand *how* and *why* security flaws occur in modern applications.
